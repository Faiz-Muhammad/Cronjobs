# It's helpful, but not entirely necessary to understand cron before proceeding.

# Example:
#
 set :output, "/home/muhammad/cron/Cronjobs/fbpost.log"
#
# every 2.hours do
#   command "/usr/bin/some_great_command"
#   runner "MyModel.some_method"
#   rake "some:great:rake:task"
# end
#
# every 4.days do
#   runner "AnotherModel.prune_old_records"
# end
